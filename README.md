# Network Monitoring

The user will be able to establish contact with computers listed in the Active Directory. If the packet isn't inter-exchangable a 
log will be created where the building and room number will be listed. Later you can create network-points for specificity.

# Data
You will need the ID listed from the members of the A. Directory. It's also possible to import data directly using utils.
